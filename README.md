## Challenges

This was the first time I have worked with localStorage, although setting and getting my stored data was simple, figuring out the best way to store a users favorite gifs proved a bit tricky. I ultimately settled on storing one key/value pair with an array of objects that contained the necessary urls to retrieve the users gifs.
